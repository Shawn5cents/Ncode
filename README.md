 Local Code Generation System
```

</div>

## üéØ Project Goals

Ncode aims to revolutionize local code generation by providing:
- **Efficient Code Generation**: Fast and accurate code suggestions
- **Local Execution**: Privacy-focused, runs entirely on your machine
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports multiple models and configurations
- **Developer Productivity**: Streamlines coding workflows

## üß† Technical Stack

### Core Components
- **Python 3.10+**: Primary programming language
- **LLaMA Models**: Base models for code generation
- **PyTorch**: Model inference and GPU acceleration
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **aiohttp**: Async HTTP operations

### Key Libraries
- **Transformers**: Model loading and inference
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Data processing and analysis
- **Loguru**: Advanced logging capabilities
- **Pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework

## üöÄ What's New in v2.0.0

### Major Enhancements
- **Improved Model Performance**: Up to 40% faster code generation
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- **New Attention Mechanisms**: Support for advanced attention configurations
- **Better Resource Management**: Optimized memory usage and GPU utilization

### Known Issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Occasional memory leaks during long sessions (fix in progress)
- **Model Switching**: Some instability when switching between models
- **GPU Utilization**: Suboptimal GPU usage on certain hardware configurations

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Improve memory management for long-running sessions
- [ ] Stabilize model switching functionality
- [ ] Optimize GPU utilization across different hardware
- [ ] Enhance error messages for better debugging
- [ ] Improve documentation for new features
